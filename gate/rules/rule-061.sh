# Rule 61 — legacy_powershell_gate_deprecated (v2.0.0-rc2 / second-pass review P0-1)
#
# The PowerShell architecture-sync gate (gate/check_architecture_sync.ps1) was
# frozen at Rule 29 in 2026-05 while the bash gate evolved to Rule 60+. The
# second-pass review (docs/logs/reviews/2026-05-16-l0-w2x-rc1-second-pass-architecture-review.en.md
# §P0-1) required choosing one of two postures. v2.0.0-rc2 picked the
# canonical-bash posture per the response document. This rule asserts BOTH
# halves of that posture:
#   (a) The PS script header carries the DEPRECATED marker.
#   (b) The PS script is NOT listed in architecture-status.yaml under
#       architecture_sync_gate.implementation: (a deprecated_implementations:
#       sibling key is allowed).
# Drift would let a stale "30-rule pass surface" be re-presented as a shipped
# architecture-sync gate.
