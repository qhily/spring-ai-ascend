# Rule 100 — kernel_implementation_disjunction_truth (enforcer E141)
#
# Closes rc10 post-corrective review P1-3 (J-γ family): Rule 96 kernel said
# "the matching CLAUDE.md kernel block MUST contain" while the impl accepted
# EITHER the kernel OR the rule card. The "AND vs OR" drift was a Code-as-
# Contract violation in the rule whose job is preventing kernel/deferred drift.
#
# Rule 100 narrows the check to an explicit allow-list of rules that declare
# "either / OR" semantics in their kernel: for each allow-list rule, both the
# kernel text and the rule card text MUST contain explicit disjunction wording
# (EITHER / OR / either surface / either ... or ...). The allow-list lives at
# gate/rule-100-disjunction-allowlist.txt (one rule id per line).
#
# Why allow-list scope: a fully-general "kernel AND vs impl ||" parser is
# fragile (bash predicate grammar varies; some rules use multi-stage checks).
# The allow-list captures the rules where the disjunction is structurally
# load-bearing.
