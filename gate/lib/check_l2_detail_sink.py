"""Gate check: L2-detail-sink — implementation detail that leaked into L0/L1 prose.

Authority: docs/governance/rules/rule-G-27.md (kernel Rule G-27), enforcer E195,
gate Rule 145 (advisory). Encodes the adjudicated layer-purity VERDICT: an
L0 / L1 architecture document is a STRUCTURAL boundary surface and MUST NOT
carry runtime L2 implementation detail. The detail belongs in
architecture/docs/L2/ (when those land) and the contract surfaces under
docs/contracts/ + the generated facts under architecture/facts/generated/.

This is the *document-prose* analog of Rule G-28's per-ADR altitude control:
G-28 rejects an L2-altitude `decision_type` in an L0/L1 normalized ADR view;
this rule reports L2-altitude *prose* (SQL/RLS/GUC, HTTP status+verb behaviour,
on-wire formats, method signatures + call chains, filter ordering, concrete
test-class inventories) in an L0/L1 ARCHITECTURE / view markdown.

VERDICT split (the keep-list is NOT reported — only the leak-list is):

  DEFENSIBLE (stays at L0/L1, never flagged):
    * naming a public SPI *type* as a boundary identity (a noun: `Orchestrator`,
      `Checkpointer`, `ResilienceContract`);
    * development-view package decomposition (`com.huawei.ascend..`,
      `<module>/src/main/java/..`);
    * citing an ArchUnit / enforcer mechanism (`enforcer E160`, `Rule R-C.e`,
      `*ArchTest`).

  LEAKED (belongs at L2 / contracts, reported here):
    * SQL / RLS / GUC / persistence DDL + semantics;
    * HTTP status code + route-verb + header runtime behaviour;
    * on-wire formats (OTLP, attribute namespaces, envelope field shapes);
    * Java method signatures + call chains (`A.b() -> C.d()`, CAS arg lists);
    * filter / interceptor ordering;
    * concrete test-class inventories used as evidence in L0/L1 prose.

Scope: architecture/docs/L0/*.md and architecture/docs/L1/**/*.md, EXCLUDING the
`_template/` scaffolds (placeholder docs, not authority). Fenced code blocks are
scanned too — a `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id` inside a fenced "L2 Boundary Contract"
zone is still leaked L2 detail per the VERDICT (a sanctioned *forward-declaration
heading* does not launder the detail it contains). A single finding can be
suppressed in place with an HTML comment on the same line or the line directly
above it:

    <!-- l2-detail-sink-allow: <reason> -->

(mirrors the `secret-allowlist:` inline opt-out convention used by Rule 28c).

Ratchet (mode):
  advisory               -- report every finding to stderr, always exit 0.
  changed-files-blocking -- exit 1 only if a finding lands on a file passed via
                            --changed (a PR may not add/worsen a leak on a file
                            it touches); other findings stay advisory.
  blocking               -- exit 1 if any finding exists (terminal rung, once the
                            L0/L1 corpus has been swept clean).

Usage:
    python3 gate/lib/check_l2_detail_sink.py                       # advisory
    python3 gate/lib/check_l2_detail_sink.py --mode blocking

        --mode changed-files-blocking
    python3 gate/lib/check_l2_detail_sink.py --repo /path/to/repo

Exit codes:
    0 -- mode satisfied (advisory always; *-blocking when no blocking finding)
    1 -- a blocking finding under the active mode, OR a fatal config error

# Delegation-pointer guard.
#
# The layer-purity verdict KEEPS, at L0/L1, the DELEGATION of a forbidden
# category to its authoritative home: a sentence that NAMES a category noun
# only to say "this detail lives in <contract/L2/fact>, not here" is the
# OPPOSITE of a leak — it is the boundary doc doing its job. A purely
# topic-anchored regex (e.g. the bare noun "wire shape", "traceparent",
# "filter ordering") cannot tell that delegation pointer from an inlined
# format/ordering leak, so without this guard the cleanup waves' own
# delegation prose trips the scan. Two signals, BOTH required within a small
# neighbourhood (the markdown bullet/sentence a match sits in spans a few
# physical lines), mark a delegation pointer:
#
#   * an explicit DELEGATION cue — a verb/phrase that hands the detail off
#     ("delegated to", "owned downstream", "lives in", "not (re)stated here",
#     "does not carry", "is contract material", "verification material",
#     "governed by", "(authority)", a "Wire shape:" forward-heading); and
#   * a HOME reference — a contract path, an architecture/docs/L2/ path, a
#     generated-fact path, a `*.v1.yaml`, or an `ADR-NNNN` pointer.
#
# An inlined leak (a `SET LOCAL` GUC, an `ON CONFLICT` clause, a concrete
# `gen_ai.*` namespace, a `00-<trace_id>-<span_id>-01` grammar, a numeric
# `@Order`) carries the MECHANISM on the line and is not redeemed by a
# neighbouring pointer; the dated grandfather list remains the sole tolerance
# for any genuinely-leaked-but-not-yet-migrated block.
