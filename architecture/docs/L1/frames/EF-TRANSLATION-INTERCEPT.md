# `EF-TRANSLATION-INTERCEPT` — Translation Tool Intercept Frame

> The model/tool/memory/retrieval interception boundary of `agent-service`: it owns the
> Platform Resource Interception SPI surface that an in-process Agent calls instead of a
> vendor SDK, so platform policy is applied at the model-call boundary before any provider
> is reached.

## 2. Capability Boundary

> AUTHORED prose. Package names are CITED (they must exist); the lists below are the
> human-readable boundary, not a second registry.

**Can do** — the responsibilities that live inside this frame:

- Declare the Platform Resource Interception SPI surface that an in-process Agent invokes at
  the model-call boundary: model invocation
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-intercept-spi-platformchatclient`),
  tool-call execution
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-intercept-spi-platformtoolcallback`),
  read-only session-context provision
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-intercept-spi-platformmemoryprovider`),
  and retrieval-reference lookup
  (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-intercept-spi-platformretriever`).
- Own the *identity* of the model/tool translation + intercept boundary — the package home
  `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime.intercept.spi` is the structural seam where an Agent's
  resource calls cross into platform governance, so that the same four contracts admit both
  Native in-process Agents (which inject these beans via DI) and Third-party adapters (which
  wrap their framework's Model / Toolkit / Memory abstractions around these contracts).

**Cannot do** — explicitly out of scope (handled by another frame or an L2 detail):

- Construct prompts. Per ADR-0155 §3 the Agent constructs its own messages list; this frame
  governs the constructed messages at the model-call boundary, it does not build them. The
  v1-draft assumption that this layer would assemble prompts is reversed.
- Own the Run aggregate, the task-centric control flow, or engine dispatch. Run/session state
  is `EF-SESSION-TASK-STATE`, cursor/cancel/resume control is `EF-TASK-CONTROL`, and engine
  dispatch is `EF-ENGINE-DISPATCH` (design-only); this frame is invoked *by* the dispatch
  plane, it does not host it.
- Run the lifecycle hook middleware chain. The ordered `RuntimeMiddleware` hook surface is
  `EF-HOOK-SURFACE` (agent-middleware); translation/intercept *composes with* that surface
  but does not replace it (the orthogonality red-line of ADR-0140 — `ChatAdvisor` lives here,
  `RuntimeMiddleware` lives in the hook plane, and identity collapse between them is
  forbidden).
- Define the over-the-wire treatment mechanics — the policy chain, PII redaction,
  token-budget audit, fallback-trim sequence, vendor-adapter routing, and the
  request/response field shapes. Those runtime sequences and over-the-wire field
  mechanics are L2 detail, delegated to this frame's deep-dive and L2 sink + the contract
  surfaces (section 5), not restated here.
- Intercept a Remote Agent's *internal* model/tool/memory/RAG calls. Those execute in the
  remote process; this boundary only governs the A2A outbound message, which is owned by the
  remote-adapter path in `EF-ENGINE-DISPATCH`, not here (ADR-0155 §4).

**Owned state** — the data/state this frame is the structural home for:

- The four interception SPI contracts themselves (the boundary identity), under
  `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime.intercept.spi`. The frame holds no aggregate, no
  persisted row, and no in-memory runtime structure — it is a contract surface plus its
  governed-messages output type, whose concrete realization is not yet implemented.

**External dependencies** — frames / modules this frame is allowed to depend on:

- `EF-SESSION-TASK-STATE` (agent-service) — the read-only session snapshot the
  `PlatformMemoryProvider` contract exposes is sourced from session/task state; this frame
  reads it, it does not own it.
- The contract surfaces it realizes (`contract-yaml/governed-messages`,
  `contract-yaml/intercept-request`, `contract-yaml/tool-result`,
  `contract-yaml/session-snapshot`) — the schemas these SPIs are declared against (section 5).

**Forbidden dependencies** — dependencies the boundary must never take (held by an
ArchUnit enforcer; cite it in section 7):

- Concrete provider/vendor SDK packages. The whole point of the interception seam is that an
  Agent invokes these SPIs *instead of* a vendor SDK and an adapter must not new-up vendor
  SDKs; a direct provider import from inside this package would bypass the boundary.
- The hook-surface internals of `EF-HOOK-SURFACE` and the runtime-control internals of
  `EF-TASK-CONTROL` — this frame composes with those planes through their declared SPIs, it
  does not reach into their implementation packages.

**Included / excluded packages** (when the frame is a package *cluster*, not a single root):

- Included: `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime.intercept.spi` (the four Platform Resource
  Interception SPI interfaces named under sections 3, 5, and 6).
- Excluded / not-yet-existing: `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime.translation` — the DSL
  reserves this as a second development path (`saa.devPaths`) for the translation
  realization, but no Java type lives there yet, so it contributes nothing to the Type
  Inventory and is not a declared `primaryPackage` (section 7).

## 3. Type Inventory

## 5. Contracts

**Exposed SPI / public surface (boundary identity):**

- `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime.intercept.spi` — the public package that *is* the
  interception boundary. Its four interfaces are the boundary identity:
  - `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime.intercept.spi.PlatformChatClient`
    (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-intercept-spi-platformchatclient`) —
    the model-call entry point.
  - `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime.intercept.spi.PlatformToolCallback`
    (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-intercept-spi-platformtoolcallback`) —
    the tool-call entry point.
  - `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime.intercept.spi.PlatformMemoryProvider`
    (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-intercept-spi-platformmemoryprovider`) —
    the read-only session-context entry point.
  - `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime.intercept.spi.PlatformRetriever`
    (`code-symbol/com-huawei-ascend-service-runtime-intercept-spi-platformretriever`) —
    the retrieval-reference entry point.

**Contract operations (OpenAPI / AsyncAPI):**

- None. This frame exposes no HTTP/AsyncAPI wire operation — its entry points are in-process
  SPI methods, so the generated `contract-surfaces.json` carries no `contract-op/*` for it.
  The schema contracts these SPIs are declared against are document-level facts:

| Schema contract | Fact ID | Contract source |
|---|---|---|
| Governed messages (model-call boundary output) | `contract-yaml/governed-messages` | `docs/contracts/governed-messages.v1.yaml` |
| Intercept request (tool-call boundary input) | `contract-yaml/intercept-request` | `docs/contracts/intercept-request.v1.yaml` |
| Tool result (tool-call boundary output) | `contract-yaml/tool-result` | `docs/contracts/tool-result.v1.yaml` |
| Session snapshot (memory-read output) | `contract-yaml/session-snapshot` | `docs/contracts/session-snapshot.v1.yaml` |

**Consumed contracts** (operations this frame calls on another frame):

- None as a wire operation. The session snapshot the `PlatformMemoryProvider` contract
  returns is sourced from session/task state (`EF-SESSION-TASK-STATE`); that read is an
  in-process structural dependency (section 2), not a `contract-op/*` call this frame issues.

## 6. FunctionPoint Mapping

> AUTHORED prose over the frame's DSL `anchors` edges. List ONLY FunctionPoints the DSL
> anchors to this frame (`efTranslationIntercept -> fp<Name>` in `engineering-frames.dsl`).
> A `design_only` frame may anchor zero FunctionPoints — say so.

**This frame anchors zero FunctionPoints.** In `architecture/features/engineering-frames.dsl`
the only edges incident on `efTranslationIntercept` are:

- `genModule_agent_service -> efTranslationIntercept` with `saa.rel "contains"` — the
  structural-axis membership edge (the `agent-service` module contains this frame), and
- `featEngineDispatchAndHooks -> efTranslationIntercept` with `saa.rel "traverses"` — a
  value-axis crossing (the Engine-Dispatch-and-Hooks Feature *routes across* this frame).
  Per ADR-0157, a `traverses` edge is a route across the structural map, **never** ownership,
  and it anchors no FunctionPoint to the frame.

There is no `saa.rel "anchors"` edge to `efTranslationIntercept`, so no FunctionPoint is
mapped here. The four SPI interfaces are the declared boundary surface (sections 3 and 5);
they become FunctionPoint anchors only when the DSL adds `anchors` edges and an
implementation backs them — until then the FunctionPoint table is intentionally empty.

## 7. Verification

> AUTHORED prose. The constraints, ArchUnit enforcers, and gate rules that hold this
> boundary. Cite each enforcer / rule as a structural identifier (not version metadata).

**Constraints / enforcers holding the boundary:**

- The Frame-Card consistency gate holds this card's identity block against the
  `efTranslationIntercept` DSL element (`saa.id` / `saa.owner` / `saa.status` /
  `saa.primaryPackage` / `saa.cardPath`) and cross-checks every `fact_refs` entry against
  `architecture/facts/generated/*.json` (ADR-0161). Because the frame is `design_only` with
  no declared `primaryPackage`, the gate does not require a fact-cited FunctionPoint anchor.
- The SPI-purity boundary for `agent-service` runtime SPI packages is held by the module's
  ArchUnit suite under `com.huawei.ascend.service.runtime.architecture` — the
  interception SPI package must stay free of concrete provider/vendor SDK imports so the
  interception seam cannot be bypassed (section 2 forbidden dependencies).

**Tests anchoring the behaviour** (fact-cited):

- None. No test in `architecture/facts/generated/tests.json` exercises the four interception
  SPIs — they are declarations with no implementation to drive. (The engine middleware hooks
  integration test `test/com-huawei-ascend-engine-runtime-runtimemiddlewareinterceptshooksit`
  belongs to the hook plane / `EF-HOOK-SURFACE`, not to this frame, despite the lexical
  overlap of "intercept".)

> **Missing proof before promotion to `shipped`:** the DSL element declares no
> `saa.primaryPackage`; the frame ships four SPI interfaces but **no implementation** that
> realizes them (no model-call governor, no tool/memory/retrieval adapter), the `translation`
> development path holds no Java type, the frame anchors **zero** FunctionPoints, and no
> fact-cited test exercises the boundary. Until an implementation lands behind these SPIs,
> the DSL adds `anchors` edges for the resulting FunctionPoints, a `primaryPackage` is
> declared, and that behaviour is contract- and test-backed, this frame stays `design_only`
> and carries only the SPI surface in its Type Inventory.
