# L2 — `run-http-contract` (Run lifecycle HTTP wire contract)

This L2 feature sink is the **detail home** for the `POST /v1/runs` (and
sibling run-lifecycle verb) **wire-level + edge-composition + CAS-realization**
behaviour. It exists to receive the L2-altitude implementation detail that the
layer-purity verdict ruled does NOT belong in L0 / L1 prose:

- HTTP status-code + route-verb + header runtime behaviour;
- on-wire request / response envelope field shapes;
- the idempotency body-lifetime sequence (claim hash, body-drift, replay);
- the access-edge servlet **filter-chain registration order** (the numeric
  `FilterRegistrationBean` ordering of the trace / JWT-cross-check / tenant /
  idempotency filters);
- the cancel-verb **method-level CAS realization** (`updateIfNotTerminal`
  compare-and-set + `RunStateMachine.validate` inside the CAS) and the
  cancel-vs-complete **race winner/loser sequence**.

## Authority chain (read top-down)

This L2 feature is a **readable interpretation layer**. It MUST NOT invent
operation IDs, status codes, or field names — every wire fact below is sourced
from the authoritative surfaces, in cascade order:

1. **Contract surface (binding wire authority)** —
   [`../../../../docs/contracts/openapi-v1.yaml`](../../../../docs/contracts/openapi-v1.yaml),
   operation `createRun` (`POST /v1/runs`), with `getRun` and `cancelRun` as
   the sibling run-lifecycle verbs. Schemas `CreateRunRequest`, `TaskCursor`,
   `RunResponse`, `ErrorEnvelope`; parameters `TenantIdHeader`,
   `IdempotencyKeyHeader`. The extracted operation facts (the IDs L0 §4 #37
   cites) are `contract-op/createrun`, `contract-op/getrun`, and
   `contract-op/cancelrun` in
   [`../../../facts/generated/contract-surfaces.json`](../../../facts/generated/contract-surfaces.json)
   — each carries the canonical `http_method`, `path`, and `response_status_codes`.
2. **L1 module design (structural parent)** — the agent-service Access Layer
   (Layer 1), where `POST /v1/runs` is the ingress edge:
   [`../../L1/agent-service/features/access-layer.md`](../../L1/agent-service/features/access-layer.md)
   (feature AS-L1-F01 protocol ingress convergence, AS-L1-F05 tenant / auth /
   idempotency binding).
3. **L1 process view (sequence parent)** —
   [`../../L1/agent-service/process.md`](../../L1/agent-service/process.md)
   §P1 (synchronous intake → state machine) shows the same ingress at L1
   structural altitude; this L2 sink carries its wire-level expansion.
4. **L0 constraint authority** —
   [`../../L0/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../L0/ARCHITECTURE.md) §4 (the §4 constraint
   corpus that names the boundary without carrying its wire detail).

## View files

| File | View | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| [`logical.md`](logical.md) | logical | `POST /v1/runs` request / response wire shapes + the run-lifecycle HTTP status-code matrix (the wire detail migrated out of L0 §4 #37 and the L1 agent-service `ARCHITECTURE.md` runs-API enumeration). |
| [`development.md`](development.md) | development | Access-edge servlet **filter-chain registration order** — the numeric `FilterRegistrationBean` ordering of `TraceExtractFilter` / `JwtTenantClaimCrossCheck` / `TenantContextFilter` / `IdempotencyHeaderFilter` (the L5 filter-ordering detail migrated out of the L1 agent-service `ARCHITECTURE.md` §2.A + §9.2). |
| [`process.md`](process.md) | process | Idempotency body-lifetime sequence (claim hash, `idempotency_conflict` vs `idempotency_body_drift`, W2 replay) **and** the cancel-verb CAS realization + cancel-race winner/loser sequence (`updateIfNotTerminal` compare-and-set, the `WHERE status NOT IN (...)` predicate, the 200-vs-409 outcome matrix) migrated out of the L1 agent-service `logical.md` §3 + `process.md` P3/P6. |

A view is added only when its detail actually migrates here; the trace-filter
*wire* behaviour (W3C `traceparent` grammar, MDC slice lifetime) stays in the
sibling [`../telemetry-vertical/`](../telemetry-vertical/) sink — this sink's
development view cites the trace filter only for its chain *position*. The
tenant-isolation persistence half (RLS policy, `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id` GUC)
lives in its own L2 detail home, not here.

## What stays upstream (NOT migrated here)

Per the verdict keep-list, the following remain at L0 / L1 and are only
*referenced* from this sink, never duplicated:

- the L0 §4 #37 *cross-document consistency invariant* (cross-check-not-replace
  tenant identity, DFA-initial run status, cancel-as-state-transition) — L0 owns
  the invariant; this sink owns the verbs, routes, status codes, and headers;
- naming `RunController` / the Access Layer as a boundary identity, and naming the
  four edge filters as Access-Layer components (their *registration order* is this
  sink's `development.md`);
- naming the Run aggregate's single-owner `RunRepository` SPI as the
  status-transition boundary (per ADR-0142) — the *atomic-CAS realization* and the
  concurrent-writer resolution are this sink's `process.md` §4–§6;
- the development-view package decomposition of the Access Layer;
- citing the ArchUnit / gate enforcer that pins the boundary.

## Gate behaviour

- Rule 37 (`architecture_artefact_front_matter`): every file here declares
  `level: L2` + a `view:` from `{logical|development|process|physical|scenarios}`.
- Rule 38 (`architecture_graph_well_formed`): the `relates_to:` front-matter
  links upward to the L1 agent-service views (structural parent) and the
  OpenAPI contract surface (wire authority).
- Rule 145 (`l2_detail_sink`, advisory): this tree is the sanctioned **sink**
  for the HTTP-runtime / wire-format leak families — detail flagged in L0 / L1
  prose migrates *here* to clear the finding.
