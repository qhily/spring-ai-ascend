# L0 Constraints

## Purpose

This document summarizes L0 architectural constraints and invariants. The
archived `docs/archive/ARCHITECTURE.md` remains historical source material
during consolidation; this document groups promoted constraints into a
reviewable shape.

## Cross-Cutting Verticals

### Tenant Vertical

Tenant identity must be carried from the edge into runtime and persistence.
Every persisted platform row that belongs to a tenant must carry tenant identity.
Runtime production code must not rely on HTTP-edge ThreadLocal tenant state
outside the sanctioned boundary.

### Posture Vertical

`APP_POSTURE` is read at boot and controls fail-closed defaults. Development,
research, and production posture behavior must be explicit. Missing required
configuration in stricter postures fails closed.

### Telemetry Vertical

Telemetry is a first-class vertical. Trace, span, LLM call, runtime event, audit,
and cost evidence must be emitted through approved carriers such as
`TraceContext` or hook surfaces. Provider adapters must not become independent
telemetry sinks.

### Audit and Policy Vertical

Security decisions, irreversible tool calls, approval decisions, cross-boundary
handoffs, and lifecycle transitions require audit evidence. Policy refusal must
be observable and must not create hidden side effects.

### Capacity and Backpressure Vertical

Long-running work is admitted through bounded runtime resource claims. Resource
pressure is represented as admission decisions, backpressure signals, suspension,
or yield, not unbounded sockets, threads, or in-flight work.

External I/O that may wait for LLM generation, vector retrieval, sandbox
execution, or third-party services must release scarce compute resources through
reactive, virtual-thread, suspend/resume, or equivalent non-holding execution
patterns. The L0 rule is resource release; specific libraries or timeout values
belong below L0.

### Developer Lifecycle Vertical

Developer experience is an architecture concern, not only documentation. Core
runtime behavior should expose enough trace, debug timeline, harness fixture,
operations evidence, and failure explanation for external Spring developers and
module contributors to integrate agents without platform-team intervention.

## Core Invariants

| Invariant | Constraint |
|---|---|
| Platform/business decoupling | Business code extends via SPI and configuration; it does not patch platform internals. |
| Single lifecycle writer | Runtime execution lifecycle state has one owner and one sanctioned writer path. |
| Governed tool calls | Tool/skill calls pass through authorization, capacity, idempotency, audit, and observability boundaries. |
| Governed interruption | User, agent, approval, cancellation, and direction-change interrupts must enter through sanctioned suspend/resume, callback, or control-command paths. |
| Context through context boundary | Context packages are produced through service/middleware context and memory/retrieval surfaces, not hidden engine logic. |
| Business state externality | Business systems own business facts; platform records references, traces, and controlled results. |
| Suspend instead of hold | Long waits use suspend/resume, cursor, or callback rather than retained physical resources. |
| Trace context propagation | Cross-module execution propagates tenant, trace, and runtime identity. |
| Side-effect safety | Irreversible side effects require idempotency or duplicate protection plus audit. |
| Child work visibility | Child execution is correlated under the parent run/task tree or explicit cross-workflow handoff. |
| Control/data/stream separation | Bus control, service streams, gateway ingress, and object-reference data paths remain separate. |

## System Boundary Constraints

- The platform is self-hostable and targets Spring Boot 4 + Java 21.
- Admin UI, multi-region replication, on-device models, and Python sidecars are
  out of current L0 scope unless accepted ADRs reintroduce them.
- In-process polyglot is treated differently from out-of-process sidecars.
- Vertical examples in historical documents are not product identity unless
  accepted architecture decisions make them so.

## Module Constraints

- Each reactor module must have module metadata and obey allowed dependency
  direction.
- Domain modules must expose SPI packages where required by module metadata and
  DFX/TCK co-design rules.
- Generated architecture fragments are not hand-edited.
- Capability aggregates do not become modules without module admission and ADR
  support.
- Heterogeneous execution frameworks are integrated through engine adapters,
  neutral SPI placement, middleware hooks, and contracts; they do not redefine
  lifecycle state ownership or bypass platform governance.

## Runtime Control Constraints

- Entry must bind tenant, actor, idempotency, posture, and trace.
- Runtime lifecycle transition must go through the sanctioned service/runtime
  owner path.
- Engine behavior returns intents or execution results; it does not bypass the
  lifecycle owner.
- Middleware surfaces enforce model, tool, memory, retrieval, prompt, and hook
  governance.
- Same-service child work is not outsourced to the bus.
- Cross-service, cross-department, or cross-deployment A2A control is mediated
  by bus/federation contracts.

## Data and State Constraints

- Tenant mismatch must fail closed at tenant-scoped surfaces.
- Business facts remain owned by business systems or delegated business-side
  stores.
- Platform trajectory, checkpoint, trace, audit, and cost evidence are platform
  runtime concerns.
- Large payloads and multimodal artifacts use data-reference paths rather than
  bus payloads.
- Untrusted generated code and unverified third-party tools must route through
  sandbox-governed capacity before stricter postures can treat them as allowed
  execution.
- Raw prompt, completion, tool input, or tool output must not appear as span
  attributes in stricter postures.

## Observability Constraints

- Every core scenario should define expected trace/event/audit evidence.
- LLM generation spans must carry model, token, cost, and latency evidence when
  runtime binding exists.
- Replay surfaces must be tenant-scoped and fail closed on mismatch.
- MCP-only replay remains the current L0 telemetry replay direction unless an
  accepted ADR changes it.

## Design Honesty Constraints

- `draft`, `candidate_promote`, `design_only`, `accepted`, and `shipped` must be
  used honestly.
- Design-only contracts must not be described as runtime-enforced behavior.
- Historical documents may provide decision evidence, but they do not override
  current architecture authority.
- Draft contract YAML under `docs/architecture/l0/05-contracts/` must not drive
  production behavior until promoted into the accepted contract system.

## Verification Expectations

Each L0 constraint should eventually map to at least one of:

- Static architecture check.
- State-machine test.
- Contract test.
- Scenario test.
- Golden trace test.
- Failure injection test.
- Security review.
- Manual architecture review.

Unverified constraints must be listed in `governance.md` as missing verification
or pending promotion.
