  Architecture review reads the NORMALIZED ADR view, not raw historical prose. Every raw ADR enumerated in `architecture/facts/generated/adrs.json` MUST have a ledger entry in `docs/governance/adr-remediation-ledger.yaml`, and every `accepted` ADR MUST have a normalized view at `docs/adr/normalized/ADR-NNNN.yaml` — this ledger-totality + normalized-view-coverage assertion (E193) is BLOCKING: the normalization wave back-filled the corpus to total coverage. Each normalized view MUST satisfy `docs/governance/adr-governance-policy.yaml` (required fields + the closed five-value `current_state` set + per-state field invariants) AND `docs/governance/adr-taxonomy.yaml` (the per-`decision_level` `decision_type` altitude — a forbidden lower-altitude `decision_type` is layer-purity leakage and is rejected); this per-view altitude validation (E192) stays advisory while its corpus is brought into altitude. Ratchet: E193 is at the full-blocking rung; E192 remains advisory, then changed-files-blocking, then full-blocking once every view is altitude-clean.

# Rule G-28 — ADR Normalization

## What

Pins the normalized-ADR review surface as the single authority an architecture
review may cite. Two assertions, both keyed off the apex authority for the raw
ADR set (`architecture/facts/generated/adrs.json`, a generated fact projection
under the ADR-0154 / Rule G-15 cascade `generated facts > DSL > Card/prose`):

1. **Ledger totality** — every raw ADR in `adrs.json` has a matching entry (by
   `adr` id) in `docs/governance/adr-remediation-ledger.yaml`.
2. **Normalized-view coverage** — every `accepted` ADR has a normalized view at
   `docs/adr/normalized/ADR-NNNN.yaml`.

Each normalized view is validated against the two hand-authored governance
policy surfaces that together fix its shape and altitude:

- `docs/governance/adr-governance-policy.yaml` — the required-field list, the
  closed five-value `current_state` set (`active_guidance`, `partial_guidance`,
  `superseded`, `historical_evidence`, `remediation_record`), and the per-state
  field-presence invariants.
- `docs/governance/adr-taxonomy.yaml` — the closed `decision_level` key set, the
  per-level `decision_type` allow / forbid lists (the layer-purity altitude
  control), and the closed `affected_level_vocabulary`.

## Why

Closes the ADR-0160 review-blocking condition: a future architecture review
cannot reliably distinguish current decision authority from historical evidence
when it reads raw ADR prose, because a single raw ADR may mix decision levels
and time states. The normalized view is the de-noised, altitude-pure projection
the review cites; the ledger guarantees no raw ADR is silently un-governed. The
`decision_type`-altitude half is the ADR-lane analogue of the Rule G-27 layer
-purity verdict: a forbidden lower-altitude `decision_type` declared at a higher
`decision_level` is the same leak, expressed as data instead of prose.

## Authority

`docs/adr/0160-adr-governance-model.yaml` (status `accepted`) — the ADR
Governance Model. It establishes that architecture review reads the normalized
view; it defines the orthogonal `decision_level` (where a decision is made) vs
`affected_levels` (what it touches) axes; and it ratifies the five-value
`current_state` set. ADR-0160 extends the fact-layer authority of ADR-0154
(`adrs.json` is the authoritative raw-ADR enumeration) and reuses the Level x
View taxonomy of ADR-0068; it sits inside the ADR-0159 progressive-learning
-curve authority lanes (governance lane L8-GOVERNANCE). The two policy surfaces
and both gate helpers cite `authority: ADR-0160` as their normative source.

## Governed artifacts

- `architecture/facts/generated/adrs.json` — the apex raw-ADR enumeration the two
  assertions read from. Generated (never hand-edited); a vanished file is fatal.
- `docs/governance/adr-remediation-ledger.yaml` — one ledger row per raw ADR; the
  ledger-totality target.
- `docs/adr/normalized/ADR-NNNN.yaml` — the per-ADR normalized views; the
  coverage target and the unit each policy surface validates.
- `docs/governance/adr-governance-policy.yaml` — required fields, the closed
  five-value `current_state` set, and the per-state field-presence invariants.
- `docs/governance/adr-taxonomy.yaml` — the closed `decision_level` set, the
  per-level `decision_type` allow/forbid lists, and the `affected_level_vocabulary`.
- `gate/lib/check_adr_taxonomy.py` (E192) and
  `gate/lib/check_historical_adr_governance.py` (E193) — the executable
  consumers; they cross-reference the surfaces above and invent no ADR id and no
  relationship.

## Required behavior

- Every raw ADR id in `adrs.json` resolves to exactly one ledger row in
  `docs/governance/adr-remediation-ledger.yaml`.
- Every `accepted` ADR has a normalized view file at the canonical path
  `docs/adr/normalized/ADR-NNNN.yaml`.
- Every normalized view carries the required fields of
  `adr-governance-policy.yaml` and a `current_state` drawn from the closed
  five-value set.
- Each `current_state` satisfies its field-presence invariant: a `superseded`
  view declares `superseded_by`; a `partial_guidance` view declares
  `non_authoritative_legacy_content`; a `historical_evidence` view carries no
  `active_guidance`.
- Each view's `decision_type` is in the `allowed_decision_types` of its declared
  `decision_level` per `adr-taxonomy.yaml`.
- An architecture review cites the normalized view as authority, not the raw
  historical ADR prose.

## Forbidden behavior

- A raw ADR present in `adrs.json` with no ledger entry (un-governed raw ADR).
- An `accepted` ADR with no normalized view (uncovered decision authority).
- A normalized view whose `decision_type` is in the `forbidden_decision_types`
  for its `decision_level` — the layer-purity leak in the ADR lane.
- A normalized view that violates a per-state invariant (e.g. `superseded`
  without `superseded_by`, `partial_guidance` without a legacy-content split, a
  `historical_evidence` view still carrying `active_guidance`).
- Hand-editing `adrs.json`; it is a generated fact and only the extractor writes
  it. Its disappearance is fatal in every mode so a vanished apex fact never
  green-washes.

## How it works

The single gate Rule 144 invokes two helpers at different ratchet rungs:

- `gate/lib/check_adr_taxonomy.py` (E192) — runs **advisory** (reports findings
  but never blocks while the per-view altitude corpus is brought clean).
  Validates each normalized view against the two policy surfaces. A
  `decision_type` that is forbidden at its `decision_level` is reported as
  lower-altitude leakage; a `superseded` view with no `superseded_by`, a
  `partial_guidance` view with no `non_authoritative_legacy_content`, or a
  `historical_evidence` view that still carries `active_guidance` each violate a
  per-state invariant. PyYAML is required; its absence is a config error.
- `gate/lib/check_historical_adr_governance.py` (E193) — runs **blocking**
  (`--mode blocking`): ledger totality + normalized-view coverage. The
  normalization wave back-filled the ledger and `docs/adr/normalized/` to total
  coverage, so a non-zero helper rc — a raw ADR with no ledger entry, an
  `accepted` ADR with no normalized view, OR a vanished apex `adrs.json` (fatal
  in every mode) — now fails the gate.

Neither helper invents an ADR id or a relationship — they cross-reference the
generated raw-ADR set, the ledger, and the on-disk normalized views only. A
missing helper fails closed; a missing python interpreter is a vacuous pass
(Rule G-7 lists WSL as the canonical env).

## Enforcer command

Both helpers run under WSL/Linux per Rule G-7. The gate (Rule 144) drives the
helpers at their wired rungs — E192 advisory, E193 blocking — but each helper is
directly runnable:

```bash
# E192 — per-view taxonomy + state invariants (gate wires it advisory)
python3 gate/lib/check_adr_taxonomy.py --mode advisory
python3 gate/lib/check_adr_taxonomy.py --mode changed-files-blocking --base origin/main
python3 gate/lib/check_adr_taxonomy.py --mode full-blocking

# E193 — ledger totality + normalized-view coverage (gate wires it blocking)
python3 gate/lib/check_historical_adr_governance.py --mode advisory
python3 gate/lib/check_historical_adr_governance.py --mode blocking

# Both as the gate runs them, inside the architecture sync gate
bash gate/check_architecture_sync.sh
```

Note the two helpers use different mode vocabularies: the taxonomy helper takes
`advisory` / `changed-files-blocking` / `full-blocking`; the historical helper
takes `advisory` / `changed-files` / `blocking`.

## Ratchet

advisory → changed-files-blocking (a PR may not add or worsen a finding on a
changed view) → full-blocking (the terminal posture once the corpus is complete).
The helper modes (`--mode advisory` / `changed-files-blocking` / `full-blocking`
for the taxonomy helper; `advisory` / `changed-files` / `blocking` for the
historical helper) implement the rungs. The two helpers now sit at different
rungs: **E193 (historical, ledger totality + view coverage) is at the
full-blocking rung** — its corpus is complete; **E192 (taxonomy, per-view
altitude) remains advisory** until every view is altitude-clean.

## Failure and remediation

| Symptom (gate / helper output) | Root cause | Remediation |
|---|---|---|
| `BLOCKING: raw ADR ADR-NNNN has no ledger entry` (E193) | A raw ADR in `adrs.json` is not yet governed | Add an `adr: ADR-NNNN` row to `docs/governance/adr-remediation-ledger.yaml` with its remediation state |
| `BLOCKING: accepted ADR ADR-NNNN has no normalized view` (E193) | An `accepted` ADR is uncovered | Author `docs/adr/normalized/ADR-NNNN.yaml` satisfying `adr-governance-policy.yaml` and `adr-taxonomy.yaml` |
| `ERROR: adrs.json not found` (E193, any mode) | The apex generated fact vanished or was hand-deleted | Re-run the fact extractor in check mode to regenerate `architecture/facts/generated/adrs.json`; never hand-create it |
| `ADVISORY: ADR-NNNN decision_type '<x>' forbidden at decision_level '<L>'` (E192) | Lower-altitude `decision_type` leaked into a higher-altitude view | Re-classify the view to the `decision_level` whose `allowed_decision_types` includes `<x>`, or split the lower-altitude clause out to an L2/contract surface |
| `ADVISORY: ADR-NNNN current_state 'superseded' missing 'superseded_by'` (E192) | A per-state invariant is unmet | Add `superseded_by: ADR-MMMM` (or the missing field the named `current_state` requires) to the view |
| `... helper missing -- Rule G-28 / E19x` (gate) | A helper script is absent | Restore `gate/lib/check_adr_taxonomy.py` / `gate/lib/check_historical_adr_governance.py`; a missing helper fails closed by design |

Example — closing an altitude leak (E192, advisory):

```text
$ python3 gate/lib/check_adr_taxonomy.py --mode advisory
ADVISORY: docs/adr/normalized/ADR-0144.yaml decision_level=L0
  decision_type='persistence_schema' is forbidden at L0
  (allowed at: L2). 1 finding(s).
# Fix: the persistence-schema clause is L2 detail. Either set
# decision_level: L2 if the view is genuinely an L2 decision, or move the
# clause to architecture/docs/L2/<slug>/ + docs/contracts/ and keep the L0
# view to its global constraint, then re-run — 0 finding(s).
```

## Test fixtures

  - VALID  : a complete, in-altitude `active_guidance` view passes full-blocking
             with zero findings.
  - INVALID: an L2-altitude `decision_type` declared at `decision_level: L0`
             fails closed (layer-purity leakage).
  - INVALID: a `superseded` view missing `superseded_by` fails (state invariant).
  - INVALID: a `partial_guidance` view with no legacy-content split fails.
  - INVALID: a `historical_evidence` view that still carries `active_guidance`
             fails.
  - VALID  : advisory mode reports the leak but never blocks (exit 0).
  - VALID  : an accepted ADR with a ledger entry + normalized view passes
             blocking with full coverage.
  - INVALID: a raw ADR with no ledger entry fails closed (blocking).
  - INVALID: an accepted ADR with no normalized view fails closed (blocking).
  - VALID  : historical advisory mode reports the gaps but never blocks.
  - INVALID: a missing `adrs.json` fails closed (exit 1) even in advisory mode.
