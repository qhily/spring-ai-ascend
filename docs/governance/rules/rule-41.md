  **`docs/governance/skill-capacity.yaml` MUST exist and declare, per skill, both `capacity_per_tenant` and `global_capacity` fields plus a `queue_strategy` (`suspend` or `fail`). The runtime `ResilienceContract.resolve(tenant, skill)` MUST consult this matrix; over-capacity resolution MUST return `SkillResolution.reject(SuspendReason.RateLimited)` rather than admit-or-fail. The actual `Run`/dependent-step suspension transition is deferred to Rule 41.c (W2 scheduler admission). Chronos Hydration interlock with Rule 38.**

## Motivation

The L0 motivation (LucioIT W1 §7.3): a single high-frequency skill (slow external API) can exhaust the cluster's connection pool and CPU. The 2D defence net (Tenant Quota × Global Skill Capacity) lets the scheduler suspend only the Agent processes blocked on that specific skill, leaving lightweight reasoning tasks free to proceed on freed OS threads.

## What the active kernel guarantees vs. what it defers

The kernel was narrowed in v2.0.0-rc11 (rc10 post-corrective review P1-1 closure per ADR-0085). The earlier wording said "over-cap callers are SUSPENDED, not rejected"; the shipped Java surface returns a **decision envelope** (`SkillResolution.reject(SuspendReason.RateLimited)`), not a `Run` state transition. The rc11 narrowing separates two obligations:

- **Active (Rule 41 kernel)** — schema presence + runtime resolver consults matrix + over-capacity returns the right decision envelope. Asserted today by `SkillCapacityResolutionIT.suspendsSecondCallerWhenCapacityIsOne` (W1.x Phase 9, enforcer E73, gate Rule 54).
- **Deferred (Rule 41.c — W2 scheduler admission)** — translating the rejected `SkillResolution` into an actual `Run`/dependent-step `SUSPENDED` transition. Re-introduction trigger: first W2 async orchestrator that consumes `SkillResolution.reject(...)` and emits a `Run.withSuspension(...)` transition.

## Cross-references

- Enforced by Gate Rule 51 (`skill_capacity_yaml_present_and_wellformed`) — schema check.
- Enforced by Gate Rule 54 (`skill_capacity_runtime_resolver_present`) — runtime envelope behaviour (`SkillResolution.reject(SuspendReason.RateLimited)` on over-capacity).
- Architecture reference: ADR-0069 / LucioIT W1 §7.3.
- Runtime enforcement activated in W1.x Phase 9 (`SkillCapacityResolutionIT.suspendsSecondCallerWhenCapacityIsOne`, enforcer E73, gate Rule 54 per ADR-0070); the original 41.b deferral closed.
- **Rule 41.c** (deferred to W2 per `docs/CLAUDE-deferred.md`) — Run/Step Suspension Transition: maps the rejected `SkillResolution` to a `Run.SUSPENDED` transition in the W2 orchestrator.
- Cross-cited by Rule 46 ([`rule-46.md`](rule-46.md)) envelope-propagation matrix — S2C callbacks consume the `s2c.client.callback` skill capacity.
- Companion rule: Rule 38 ([`rule-38.md`](rule-38.md)) — No Thread.sleep in Business Code (Chronos Hydration interlock).
