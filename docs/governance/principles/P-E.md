  P-E — Multi-Track Bus Physical Channel Isolation.
  Cross-service internal communication is sliced into three physically
  isolated channels — `control` (out-of-band PAUSE/KILL/CANCEL intents,
  highest priority), `data` (in-band heavy-load payload bodies),
  and `rhythm` (heartbeat / liveness pulses).
  No congestion on one channel can paralyse another.
  Enforced by Rule R-E.

## Motivation

This principle exists because a single shared bus channel under load **paralyses control intents alongside data payloads** — a slow text-to-video transfer on `data` blocks a `PAUSE` intent that should arrive instantly, and the operator loses the ability to recover. The three-track split is the minimum physical isolation that lets `control` traffic preempt `data` traffic regardless of saturation, and lets `rhythm` heartbeats survive even when both control and data are degraded so the supervisor can still observe liveness. The `data` channel inherits the 16 KiB inline-payload cap (§4 #13) to bound how badly any single payload can hog its own track.
