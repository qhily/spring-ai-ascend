# Knowledge/Governance Rebalancing — Autonomous Session 1 Status

Date: 2026-06-01
Branch: `governance/knowledge-governance-separation` (off current `origin/main`)
Author: autonomous agent session (owner asleep; full decision delegation granted)
Nothing merged to `main`. Every step below is a separate, reversible commit.

## TL;DR

Major progress on the program **and** a big surprise: current `main` was already
**red** — the recent `文档整理` doc-reorg broke **264 gate checks** by moving files
without updating references. I fixed the largest pieces and landed the program's
core, taking the gate from **264 → ~60 failures**, and built the knowledge system.
Two findings need your judgment (below): the reorg tangle and a **gate fail-open**.

## What landed (8 commits)

1. `W0` — fresh branch off current `main`; discarded the abandoned in-flight ADR
   normalization; imported Codex proposal + program charter.
2. `INV` — 6-agent re-grounded inventory of current main (counts were all stale):
   155 ADRs, 57 rules, 190 enforcers, 157 gate checks, ~18 safety-core.
3. `PRE1` — **restored the architecture-of-record to top-level `architecture/`**.
   The reorg `git mv`'d it to `docs/architecture/architecture2/` (pure rename),
   breaking ~230 internal links + leaving the gate on dead paths (vacuous pass).
4. `PRE1b` — **restored `docs/contracts/*` + `docs/dfx/*` to flat paths** the gate
   hardcodes (reorg had nested them into `func/` + `dfx/`).
5. `K-infra` — **built the AI knowledge system**: `knowledge/` + the mandatory
   usage guide (`knowledge/README.md`) + advisory tooling (`check_integrity.py`,
   `search.sh`). Explicitly out of the main-path; never gated.
6. `G1 keystone` — narrowed the gate's corpus scans (Rules 18/22/23) off
   `knowledge/` and all of `docs/logs/` (history). This is the program's core act.
7. A2D corpus link-scan exclusion — `docs/architecture/` (delivery narrative,
   knowledge) excluded from Rule 23.

Result: knowledge system exists; keystone is in; main-path (architecture, contracts)
is coherent again; failures 264 → ~60.

## FINDING 1 — your reorg broke the repo (needs a direction call)

The `文档整理 / 合并*` commits on `main` moved `architecture/` → `docs/architecture/`,
nested `docs/contracts/*` into `func/`+`dfx/`, and relocated `docs/onboarding/`,
`docs/telemetry/`, `docs/cross-cutting/`, `docs/runbooks/`, `docs/delivery/` — but
the gate, status ledger, and ~hundreds of doc links still point at the old paths.
**Most of this session's effort has been repairing that reorg, not the rebalancing
program.** Open question for you: do you want me to keep repairing the reorg
piecemeal toward green, or revert the reorg wholesale and re-apply it cleanly with
references updated? (I leaned "repair toward the program's end-state topology":
governed `architecture/` + `docs/contracts/` + `docs/governance/`, non-governed
`knowledge/`.)

## FINDING 2 — the gate is fail-open (a real self-check bug)

`gate/check_architecture_sync.sh` printed 112 failures but **exited 0**. Cause: the
W5 workspace gate is in advisory soak (until 2026-06-10) and several rule loops use
pipe-subshells that lose `fail_count` increments (the `F-gate-machinery-fail-open`
family). Net: the project's "self-check" has been silently unreliable — a green exit
did not mean zero failures. Fixing this is itself part of "self-check no bugs" and
should precede trusting any green.

## Remaining failures (~60, all reorg-fallout or over-gov; categorized)

- ~40 — `active_doc_internal_links_resolve` in `architecture/docs/L1/agent-service/*`
  (architecture-of-record L1 view narratives): pre-existing malformed relative links
  (missing `docs/` segment) compounded by the move. Fix or reclassify as reference.
- 4 — `release_note_baseline_truth`: `docs/logs/releases/phase-c-merge.md` lacks the
  canonical baseline table (freeze it or add rows; note baselines change as we cut).
- 4 — `shipped_row_evidence_paths_exist`: `architecture-status.yaml` points at moved
  files (`docs/cross-cutting/posture-model.md`, `docs/telemetry/policy.md`,
  `docs/delivery/...`). Repoint or restore.
- 1 — `no_active_refs_deleted_wave_plan_paths` (Rule 15) on a `docs/logs/delivery/`
  history file → same fix as Rule 18 (exclude `docs/logs/`).
- 2 — `architecture_artefact_front_matter`: `docs/adr/adr-level-module-map.yaml`
  needs `level:`/`view:`.
- 1 — `always_loaded_budget_enforced`: `docs/onboarding/{developer,sre,architect,
  compliance-reviewer}.md` missing (reorg) → restore or drop from the budget list.
- 1 — `rule_79_runbook_present_and_cited`: `docs/runbooks/debug-first-evidence.md` missing.
- 1 — `template_render_idempotency`: stale output path `docs/L1/agent-service/README.md`.
- 1 — workspace `surface-classification.dsl` drift (regen needed; advisory in soak).

## Remaining PROGRAM work (beyond reorg-repair)

- `G-track`: retire/delete the ~118 retire-tail gate rules + prune enforcers + the
  G-13 subsumption + narrow the R-C card kernel prose. (Delicate: gate + self-tests +
  baselines in lockstep; the fail-open should be fixed first.)
- `K-track`: relocate the ~8 ADR knowledge clusters (~70 ADRs) into `knowledge/`;
  relocate the A2D corpus from `docs/architecture/` into `knowledge/architecture/`.
- `PRE2`: fix the ~10 ADR slug↔content drifts + the 0155 `.md`/`.yaml` dup.
- `R-track`: rewrite `CLAUDE.md` + `README` to the main-path/knowledge model + the
  full link-graph reconciliation.
- Reconcile baselines downward once the cuts land.

## Recommendation

Two decisions would unblock the rest: (1) reorg disposition (repair vs revert+re-apply),
(2) authorize the fail-open fix + the gate retirement (delicate) before chasing a
green that the fail-open currently fakes. The knowledge system + keystone + main-path
restores are safe to keep regardless.
