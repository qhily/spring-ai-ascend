/**
 * C3 forwarding runtime substrate — broker-agnostic, tenant-scoped, durable
 * outbox / inbox domain model, ports and state machine.
 *
 * <p>{@code com.huawei.ascend.bus.forwarding.spi} holds the pure-Java contract
 * surface (envelope, record models, ports — enqueue / mark / status, claim /
 * lease, delivery — and value types); {@code com.huawei.ascend.bus.forwarding.runtime}
 * holds the state-transition engine and the dispatcher worker skeleton. The
 * real persistent implementation (JDBC adapter / migration / polling / lease
 * store) is deferred — Stage 8 ships the record models, claim / lease port,
 * delivery port, worker skeleton, schema / migration draft and an in-memory
 * lease harness, but no production database dependency (decision §6.1).
