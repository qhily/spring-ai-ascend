/**
 * Sender-side durable-queue port for the C3 outbox substrate.
 *
 * <p>The port abstracts durable outbox storage so the domain model, state machine
 * and harness can ship without a real database; a JDBC / persistent
 * implementation lands once DB / migration ownership is decided (Stage 9 §5).
 * Implementations MUST call {@code ForwardingStateMachine} to validate a
 * transition before persisting, MUST scope every operation by {@code tenantId}
 * (tenant isolation, Rule R-C.c; cross-tenant reads fail explicitly, never fall
 * back), and — from Stage 9 (MI9-001) — MUST guard the DISPATCHING → terminal /
 * retry mutations by {@code leaseOwner}.
 *
 * <p><b>Lease-owner guarded mutation (Stage 9, MI9-001).</b> A record reaches
 * DISPATCHING only via {@link ForwardingOutboxClaimPort#claimDue}, which stamps
 * an exclusive {@link ForwardingLease}. Every outbound transition below carries
 * the caller's {@code leaseOwner}; an implementation rejects the call
 * ({@link ForwardingLeaseException}) when the record is unknown, holds no lease,
 * is leased to a different owner, or is no longer DISPATCHING. A real JDBC
 * adapter encodes this as
 * {@code WHERE tenant_id = ? AND message_id = ? AND lease_owner = ? AND lease_until > now()}.
 *
 * <p><b>Lease lifecycle (Stage 9, MI9-002).</b> ACKED / DLQ / EXPIRED clear the
 * lease (terminal); RETRY_SCHEDULED clears the lease so the next dispatch is
 * gated only by {@code nextAttemptAt}. {@code markDispatching} is intentionally
 * absent — claim / lease is the sole path into DISPATCHING, so a DISPATCHING
 * record always holds a live lease.
