/**
 * Accept / enqueue entry for the C3 forwarding substrate — the <em>gateway
 * role</em> (MI8-003).
 *
 * <p>This interface accepts a forwarding envelope, validates it, and writes it
 * into the outbox, returning the synchronous ack receipt. It is deliberately a
 * thin accept / enqueue entry: it does <strong>not</strong> drive the outbox
 * through DISPATCHING → ACK / RETRY / DLQ / EXPIRED. That claim / deliver /
 * ack / retry half of the lifecycle is the separate {@code ForwardingDispatcherWorker}
 * (runtime package), which consumes a {@code ForwardingOutboxClaimPort} and an
 * abstract {@code ForwardingDeliveryPort}. Keeping the two roles in separate
 * types resolves the Stage 7 javadoc / method mismatch: {@code dispatch} here
 * means "accept into the outbox", not "deliver to the receiver".
 *
 * <p>The gateway never bypasses {@link ForwardingRouteHandle} to a physical
 * endpoint and never writes Task execution state.
 *
 * <p>Authority: {@code architecture/L2-Low-Level-Design/agent-bus/forwarding-outbox-inbox.md §3/§8}.
