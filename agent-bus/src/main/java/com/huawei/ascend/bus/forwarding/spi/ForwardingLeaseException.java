/**
 * Raised by a lease-owner guarded outbox mutation when the caller is not the
 * current lease holder of the target record (Stage 9, MI9-001 / MI9-002).
 *
 * <p>Stage 8's {@code claimDue} grants a record to one {@code leaseOwner}; Stage 9
 * makes every subsequent state change ({@code markAcked} / {@code scheduleRetry}
 * / {@code moveToDlq} / {@code markExpired}) carry the caller's
 * {@code leaseOwner} and reject a stale / foreign holder. This prevents a worker
 * whose lease expired (and was reclaimed by another worker) from mutating a
 * record it no longer owns. A real JDBC adapter encodes the same guard as
 * {@code WHERE tenant_id = ? AND message_id = ? AND lease_owner = ? AND lease_until > now()}.
 *
 * <p>{@link Reason} distinguishes the failure mode so the harness can assert the
 * exact guard that tripped. The worker treats any
 * {@code ForwardingLeaseException} as "skip this record"; the record's true owner
 * (or the next reclaim) drives it forward.
