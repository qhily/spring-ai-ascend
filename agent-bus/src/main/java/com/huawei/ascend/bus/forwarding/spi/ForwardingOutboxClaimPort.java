/**
 * Concurrent claim / lease port for the C3 outbox substrate (Stage 8, MI8-001).
 *
 * <p>Replaces the naive {@code findRetryable(now)} projection: real persistence
 * must prevent two dispatcher instances from delivering the same outbox record
 * concurrently, so due messages are not merely <em>queried</em> — they are
 * <em>claimed</em>. {@link #claimDue} atomically selects due, tenant-scoped,
 * non-terminal records whose lease is free or expired, transitions each to
 * {@link ForwardingStatus.Outbox#DISPATCHING}, stamps an exclusive
 * {@link ForwardingLease} owned by the caller, and returns the claimed records.
 *
 * <p>Claim / lease invariants (Stage 8 plan §3 slice 3):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>claim is tenant-scoped; a cross-tenant claim returns nothing (Rule R-C.c).</li>
 *   <li>one outbox record is held by at most one lease owner at a time.</li>
 *   <li>an expired lease may be reclaimed by another owner.</li>
 *   <li>only records with {@code nextAttemptAt <= now} (or a fresh PENDING) are due.</li>
 *   <li>terminal records (ACKED / DLQ / EXPIRED) are never claimable.</li>
 *   <li>claim + the PENDING/RETRY_SCHEDULED → DISPATCHING transition happen in one
 *       atomic step (single transaction / CAS in a real JDBC adapter).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The port never bypasses {@link ForwardingRouteHandle} to a physical endpoint
 * and never writes Task execution state. A real JDBC implementation is deferred
 * (decision §6.1); Stage 8 ships this interface plus an in-memory lease harness.
 *
 * <p>Authority: {@code architecture/L2-Low-Level-Design/agent-bus/forwarding-outbox-inbox.md §4.1/§8};
