/**
 * Ownership lease stamped on a claimed outbox record by
 * {@link ForwardingOutboxClaimPort#claimDue}.
 *
 * <p>C3 persistence (Stage 8) prevents two dispatcher instances from delivering
 * the same outbox record concurrently: {@code claimDue} atomically grants the
 * record to one {@code leaseOwner} until {@code leaseUntilMillisEpoch}. Another
 * owner may reclaim the record only after the lease has expired (the holder
 * crashed or stalled mid-delivery). The lease is a Stage 8 additive field on the
 * outbox record; it carries no payload body, no token stream, no Task execution
 * state, no physical endpoint.
 *
 * <p>Authority: {@code architecture/L2-Low-Level-Design/agent-bus/forwarding-outbox-inbox.md §4.1};
