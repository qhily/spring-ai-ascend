/**
 * An engine's declaration of which {@link HookPoint} events it fires.
 *
 * <p>The Runtime uses this declaration to determine whether a registered
 * {@link RuntimeMiddleware} will ever observe its subscribed hook on this
 * engine — useful for hot-path optimisation (a middleware that subscribes to
 * {@code BEFORE_LLM_INVOCATION} can be skipped entirely if no registered
 * engine declares that hook).
 *
 * <p>The default implementation declares no hooks. At W2.x Phase 2 the
 * orchestrator fires three mandatory hooks
 * ({@link HookPoint#ON_ERROR}, {@link HookPoint#BEFORE_SUSPENSION},
 * {@link HookPoint#BEFORE_RESUME}) regardless of the engine's surface
 * declaration — those are runtime-level hooks, not engine-level.
 *
 * <p>Pure Java — no Spring imports per architecture §4.7
 * (orchestration.spi imports only java.*).
